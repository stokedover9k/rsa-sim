RSA Simulation
--------------

This project is managed and built by SBT.

To run SBT, execute the provided script sbt.sh. It will download SBT if it hasn't already and start it.
SBT will then download the Scala language and project dependencies.

Once that's done, execute "run" at the SBT prompt to run the RSA simulation.
